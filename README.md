Create a login app in angular+ node where you can maintain session by cookie 

Session can be maintained by three methods
1) cookie
2) session storage 
3) local storage - i have used local storage because localstorage provides the largest number of space 5 mb

I do have created a auth guard too

A login button is there for logging out the application and clearing the local storage
